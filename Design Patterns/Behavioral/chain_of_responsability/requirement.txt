The restaurant wants to notify loyal customers whenever new offers appear. The problem is that the restaurant owns the phone number for some customers and the email address for others. Using the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, implement a module to send notifications to customers by SMS. If the restaurant does not have the phone number in the database for certain customers, the notification will be sent by email. For customers who have not provided contact information, a notification is sent to the restaurant manager with the customer's name.
