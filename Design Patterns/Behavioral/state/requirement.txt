The restaurant wants to implement a module for managing table occupancy. A table can have one of the following states: Reserved, Occupied, Free. When a customer makes a reservation, the table changes to the Reserved state. When the customer honors the reservation the table enters the Occupied state, and when he leaves, the table enters the Free state. Implement this module using State design pattern.
