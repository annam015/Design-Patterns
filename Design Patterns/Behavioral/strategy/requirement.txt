When a customer comes to the bank, the documents are processed according to the type of customer. For natural customers, the ID card and proof of employment are requested, and for legal entity clients, the founding documents of the company as well as proof of registration with the Trade Registry are required. Implement the document verification module, knowing the fact that a customer announces when he arrives at the counter what kind of customer he is (the strategy is adopted at run-time).
