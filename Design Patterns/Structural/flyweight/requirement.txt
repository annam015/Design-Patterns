A game that involves the existence of spectators is created. For each spectator, information regarding the height, width, color of the shirt, but also its position (row and column) must be saved. Thus, if a spectator with the same size and the same color of the shirt is drawn several times, the information about him is repeated, occupying a lot of memory. Implement the module using the Flyweight design pattern so that as little memory as possible is occupied.
