# Design-Patterns

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are established solutions to common software design problems. They offer a structured and proven way to solve recurring design challenges. Design patterns can be categorized into three main groups:

1. **Creational Design Patterns:**
   - Simplify the process of object creation.
   - Examples include the Builder Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Prototype Pattern, Factory Method Pattern.

2. **Structural Design Patterns:**
   - Deal with object composition and relationships.
   - Examples include the Adapter Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Composite Pattern, Facade Pattern, Proxy Pattern.

3. **Behavioral Design Patterns:**
   - Focus on communication and cooperation between objects.
   - Examples include the Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern, State Pattern.

Each design pattern addresses specific design challenges and provides a clear and reusable solution.

## IDE Setup

This project was created using [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) and it is compatible with JavaSE-17.

## Project Structure

Within this repository, you'll find folders for each design pattern. Each pattern folder follows a consistent structure:

- **requirement.txt:** This file contains a simple problem statement that the design pattern is meant to address. It serves as a starting point for understanding the use case of the pattern.

- **classes/:** This folder contains the Java classes and interfaces required to implement the design pattern solution. You can explore the code here to see how the pattern is applied in practice.

- **main/:** This folder contains a working example that demonstrates how the design pattern is used to solve the problem stated in the `requirement.txt` file.

!!! These examples are simplified for educational purposes and may not cover all nuances of each design pattern. !!!
